<p>This code was adapted from our professor's EViews 8 simulation script for a course in Macroeconomics (PSME Fall 2018).</p>

<p>The EViews script can be found [here](https://luisreyesortiz.org/resources/) under the heading "EViews 8 simulation script for Mundell-Flemming model under a fixed exchange rate regime (static)"</p>

<p>This code was used as part of the presentation "An Introduction to R for Economics" that our group of 3 gave to our master-level macro-economics class. All the R code was written by myself.</p>
